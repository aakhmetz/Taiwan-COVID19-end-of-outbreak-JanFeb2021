"A hospital-related outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 associated with a novel variant Cal.20C (B.1.429) in Taiwan: transmission potential and outbreak containment under intensified contact tracing, January–February 2021" *Submitted* 2021.

A hospital-related cluster of 22 COVID-19 cases occurred in Taiwan in January 2021. Following proactive testing with intensive contact tracing and isolation, the outbreak was contained. These rigorous measures allowed the outbreak end to be determined with confidence 3 weeks earlier compared to a counterfactual scenario with less intense measures.

**Thank you for your interest to our work!** 

The first notebook was written in R with CmdStan used for Bayesian simulations. The second notebook used Python for graphical output for two supplementary figures.

**Words of caution**: We note that the code is not supposed to work out of box, because the links used in the notebooks can be user-specific and some part of the dataset could not be openly shared (e.g. the linelist of COVID-19 that was used for reconstruction of the epicurve). Our main intent was to show the relevance of the methods used in our paper. We are grateful for your understanding in advance.
